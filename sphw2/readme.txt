1. Execution: 

Compile the code by using make command and then to execute the program use this command: ./bidding_system.c [host_num][player_num]. 
I tested the program on a local ubuntu so it might not work on the workstation (hopefully it does).

NOTE: When there are lot of players, the program run slower (it might take 5-8s). 

2. Descriptions
The program is completed using the material that Professor Cheng Pu-Jen taught us. (select, forking, FIFO, etc)
I completed all the subcases, albeit I can't guarantee the correctness. (I believe it's correct when I tested it though)
